# 🎉 Welcome to the Dart Side! 

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Flites! Every contribution, no matter how small, makes a difference. Whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting a feature, improving documentation, or writing code, we're grateful for your help.

## 🤔 "I want to help but I'm not sure how..."

That's perfectly normal! Here are some ways you can contribute, from easiest to more involved:

### 🐞 Report Bugs or Suggest Features
- Found something that doesn't work quite right? [Open an issue](https://github.com/marqably/flites/issues/new)!
- Have an idea for a cool feature? We'd love to hear it!
- Not sure if it's a bug? Open an issue anyway - we're here to help figure it out!

### 📝 Improve Documentation
- Notice something confusing in the docs?
- Found a typo?
- Think something could be explained better?

These are all valuable contributions! You can edit files directly on GitHub - no need to set up anything locally.

### 🌍 Help with Translations
We support multiple languages and always welcome help with:
- Improving existing translations
- Adding new languages
- Fixing translation issues

### 👩‍💻 Code Contributions

Don't feel pressured to write perfect code! We value learning and collaboration over perfection. Here's how to get started:

1. **Pick an Issue**: Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
2. **Comment on the Issue**: Let us know you're interested - we'll help guide you!
3. **Ask Questions**: Stuck? Confused? Ask in the issue or discussions - we're here to help!
4. **Submit Your Changes**: Even if they're not perfect - we can work on improvements together

## 🤝 Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run the tests (`melos run test:all`)
5. Submit your Pull Request

Don't worry if:
- Tests fail - we'll help you fix them
- You're not sure about something - we'll guide you
