description: How to make contributions to the Flites codebase
---

## Setup
We are using [melos](https://melos.invertase.dev) to manage all packages inside this mono repo. Install it via:

`dart pub global activate melos`

## Checking your changes
When submitting a PR, the code base will run through pipelines that have to pass, before any changes can be merged. To check locally if your code passes, use the following commands:

### Analyze
`melos analyze`

### Format
`melos format`

### Tests
`melos run test --no-select`

## Conventions
In order to keep a clean git history, we are relying on [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Please keep these rules in mind when developing, and PR titles will be checked in the pipeline for this structure as well.
